# CS-580U Programming Systems and Tools

CS-580U course is designed to provide a solid foundation and background in basic programming techniques and concepts, as well as an overview of programming in the C language. **Program files are "NOT" classwork and assignment**. I wrote these programs to understand concepts and for skill improvemnt.
